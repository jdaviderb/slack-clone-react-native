## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node JS, a JavaScript runtime
* [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content) - a Javascript code library
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) - Yarn package manager

### Installing

* If you have npm_modules folder, delete it.
* Open the console/terminal and cd to the project's folder.
* Do "npm install" or "yarn" better, to install referenced packages.
* If you have ran the project before, and now you are getting an unknown error, do "cd android && gradlew clean && cd ..", it might be fixed.
* Do "react-native run-android".
